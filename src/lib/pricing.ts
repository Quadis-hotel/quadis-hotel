 *      EP: No additional charge
 *      CP (Breakfast): +25%
 *      MAP (All Meals Included): +50%
 *    This percentage should be applied automatically across all hotels based on
 *    the base room rate. Currently, the CP and MAP prices are displaying
 *    incorrectly, so implementing percentage-based pricing will ensure accurate
 *    and consistent rates across all properties."
 *
 * EP / CP / MAP are the trade's names for the three plans this site already
 * sells as "Room Only" / "With Breakfast" / "All Meals Included", in that order.
 *
 * What this replaces: a flat supplement per room category — ₹300/₹800 on a
 * Deluxe, ₹350/₹900 on a Super Deluxe, ₹450/₹1,200 on a Royal. Flat rupees are
 * what she means by "displaying incorrectly": ₹300 of breakfast on Cladis 15's
 * ₹1,800 Deluxe is a 17% uplift, and the same ₹300 on Amar Inn's ₹3,000 Deluxe
 * is 10%. The same plan cost a different fraction at every property, which is
 * precisely the inconsistency the percentage removes.
 *
 * These are group-wide and deliberately NOT per property or per category. "The

 * would let one property drift and would have to be mirrored into this bundle

 *
 * Reading it any other way breaks the client's arithmetic. Measuring off the

 * GST on accommodation, SAC 996311.

 * The client, 5 Aug 2026: "our gst is 5%, so please replace 12% with 5%".
 *
 * That reads like a mistake and is not. Until the September 2025 rate revision
 * a room under ₹7,500 a night was taxed at 12%; the revision retired that slab
 * and taxes the same rooms at 5%, charged without input tax credit. The upper
 * slab was left at 18%. So the client is quoting the rate her accountant is
 * actually filing at, and the 12% this codebase shipped with is simply out of
 * date — it was correct when it was written.
 *
 * The 18% slab stays, and as of 1 Sep 2026 it is no longer hypothetical — one
 * room in the group now reaches it. Hotel Amaltas International's Superior is
 * ₹6,000 before meals, and All Meals Included adds 50%, so it quotes ₹9,000
 * inclusive: a value of supply of ₹8,571, past the line. It is the only such
 * combination in the portfolio; see the exact-set assertion in
 * backend/__tests__/pricing.test.ts, which is what will catch the next one.
 *
 * The near miss is worth keeping in view too. A Royal Suite at East of Kailash
 * or Amar Inn is ₹5,000 before meals, so All Meals puts it at exactly ₹7,500 —
 * the threshold to the rupee, and INSIDE the 5% band once converted to a value
 * of supply. Under the flat supplements it retired it was ₹6,200 and nowhere
 * near. So the upper slab must neither be deleted, which would under-collect on
 * the bookings worth the most, nor applied a rupee too early.
 *
 * These three constants are duplicated in backend/src/lib/pricing.ts, which is
 * authoritative for what the guest is charged. The duplication is deliberate —
 * this bundle cannot import from backend/, and the checkout summary must show
 * the same rate the invoice charges. Change one, change the other; there is no
 * build step that will catch a divergence.

 *
 * The slab, however, is defined on the VALUE OF SUPPLY — the figure net of GST —
 * so the two have to be converted before they can be compared. This used to
 * compare the inclusive rupees straight against ₹7,500, which was wrong, and was
